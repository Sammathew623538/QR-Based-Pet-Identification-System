🚀 **Excited to showcase my latest full-stack project: Smart Pet QR — An Intelligent IoT-Enabled Pet Safety Platform!** 🐾

This application is designed to modernize pet identification by bridging the physical and digital worlds. It creates a dynamic digital identity for pets, allowing instant data retrieval and real-time tracking during emergencies.

🔹 **Key Technical Features:**

✔️ **Automated Digital Identity System**: Programmatically generates unique QR codes with embedded pet imagery using **Python & Pillow**.

✔️ **Real-Time Geolocation Intelligence**: Integrates IP-based triangulation APIs to capture and log the exact location & timestamp of every scan.

✔️ **Instant Alert System**: Implements **Django SMTP** to trigger immediate email notifications to owners upon detection.

✔️ **Dynamic Asset Generation**: Uses **ReportLab** to instantaneously render high-resolution "Missing" PDF posters with live database content.

✔️ **Secure Role-Based Architecture**: Features comprehensive authentication, staff dashboards, and secure profile management.

✔️ **Scalable E-Commerce Module**: Includes a fully functional ordering system for NFC-enabled physical tags.

🔹 **Tech Stack:**

**Backend:** Python | Django 5.x | Django REST Concepts
**Core Libraries:** Pillow (Image Processing) | ReportLab (PDF) | Requests
**Frontend:** HTML5 | CSS3 | Bootstrap 5 | JavaScript
**Database:** SQLite (Dev) / PostgreSQL (Ready)
**Tools:** Git | GitHub | VS Code

🎯 **Engineering Impact:**
Building this project challenged me to handle **binary data manipulation** (images/PDFs) within a web request cycle and implement **real-world IoT concepts** (tracking physical scans). It drastically improved my understanding of the Django MVT architecture and secure data handling.
